# Copy, Paste and Increment

This plugin takes selected text and duplicates it `N` times, individually incrementing all the numbers found within. It does _not_ preserve 0 padding (e.g. test0001.jpg -> test2.jpg). If you're insterested in this feature, please open an [issue](https://git.xvrqt.com/amy/duplicate-and-increment/issues).

## Shortcut
`super + shift + alt + v`

Opens a text prompt at the bottom of the screen asking how many times you would like to duplicate the section.

`super + shift + ctrl + v`

Duplicates the selected region 1 time. Does not ask for input.
